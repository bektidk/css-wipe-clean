# CSS Wipe Clean

CSS Wipe Clean is a collection of essential CSS techniques that focus on resetting and clearing default browser styles to provide a clean slate for your web projects.

## Overview

This repository contains two main components:

1. **CSS Reset**: A stylesheet to reset browser styles and provide a consistent baseline across different browsers.
2. **CSS Clearfix**: A technique to handle floating elements in layouts, ensuring that parent containers expand to contain their child elements properly.

## Sources

- **CSS Reset**  
  The original CSS Reset code is sourced from [Meyer Web](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/), a widely used and well-regarded reset stylesheet created by Eric Meyer.

- **CSS Clearfix**  
  The clearfix code is based on the version provided by [Nicolas Gallagher](https://nicolasgallagher.com/micro-clearfix-hack/), a micro clearfix hack that efficiently clears floats in modern web layouts.

## Usage

To use the CSS reset and clearfix styles, simply copy the respective code from this repository and include it in your project. These styles help ensure that your design starts with a clean base, removing default browser styles and resolving layout issues related to floating elements.
